In one of your relative path extensions modules, create a class that inherits from ContextHook , and override its hook method: from copier_templates_extensions import ContextHook class ContextUpdater ( ContextHook ): def hook ( self , context ): new_context = {} new_context [ \"say\" ] = \"hello \" + context [ \"name\" ] return new_context Using the above example, your context will be updated with the new_context returned by the method. If you prefer to modify the context in-place instead, for example to remove items from it, set the update class attribute to False : from copier_templates_extensions import ContextHook class ContextUpdater ( ContextHook ): update = False def hook ( self , context ): context [ \"say\" ] = \"hello \" + context [ \"name\" ] del context [ \"name\" ] In your Jinja templates, you will now have access to the {{ say }} variable directly. This can be extremely useful in template projects where you don't want to ask too many questions to the users and instead infer some values from their answers. Consider the following example: you ask your users if they want to generate a CLI app or a web API. Depending on their answer, the main Python module should be named cli.py or app.py . Without the context hook, you would need to write a Jinja macro somewhere, or update the context directly in Jinja, and import this file (still using Jinja) in the filename of the module : {# using macros #} {% - macro module_name () %} {% - if project_type == \"webapi\" %} app {% else %} cli {% endif %} {% - endmacro %} {# or enhancing the context #} {#- Initiate context with a copy of Copier answers -#} {% - set ctx = _copier_answers.copy () - %} {#- Populate our new variables -#} {% - set _ = ctx.update ({ \"module_name\" : ( \"app\" if project_type == \"webapi\" else \"cli\" ) - %} \ud83d\udcc1 template_root \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 copier.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 macros # the macros file \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 context # the context file \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 extensions \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 slugify.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 {{project_name|slugify}} \u2502 \u2502 # using the macros \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 {% import 'macros' as macros with context %}{{macros.module_name()}}.py.jinja \u2502 \u2502 # or using the enhanced context \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 {% from 'context' import ctx with context %}{{ctx.module_name}}.py.jinja As you can see, both forms are really ugly to write: the macros or context can only be placed in the root, as slashes / are not allowed in filenames you must use spaces and single-quotes (double-quotes are not valid filename characters on Windows) in your templated filenames, which is not clean filenames are very long Using our context hook instead makes it so easy and clean! from copier_templates_extensions import ContextHook class ContextUpdater ( ContextHook ): def hook ( self , context ): return { \"module_name\" : \"app\" if context [ \"project_type\" ] == \"webapi\" else \"cli\" } \ud83d\udcc1 template_root \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 copier.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 extensions \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 slugify.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 context.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc1 {{project_name|slugify}} \u2514\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc4 {{module_name}}.py.jinja How does it work? \u00a4 Beware the ugly hack!
